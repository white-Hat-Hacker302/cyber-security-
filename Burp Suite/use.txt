 Step 1: Launch Burp Suite
Open Terminal in Kali Linux.

Type the following to launch Burp Suite:

bash
Copy
Edit
burpsuite
Or use the GUI:

Go to Applications → Web Application Analysis → Burp Suite.

⚙️ Step 2: Initial Setup
Choose "Temporary Project" → Click Next.

Select "Use Burp Defaults" → Click Start Burp.

The main Burp Suite dashboard will open.

🌐 Step 3: Configure Browser to Use Burp Proxy
Burp Suite uses localhost:8080 as a proxy by default.

Option 1: Firefox (preferred for testing)
Open Firefox.

Go to:

Preferences → Settings → Network Settings → Click "Manual proxy configuration".

Set:

HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1

Port: 8080

Check: "Use this proxy for all protocols"

Save and close.

🔐 Step 4: Install Burp Certificate (for HTTPS)
In Firefox, visit:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://burpsuite
Click: CA Certificate → Save the .cer file.

Go to Firefox Settings:

Privacy & Security → Certificates → View Certificates → Authorities → Import

Select the .cer file and trust it.

🔍 Step 5: Intercept Requests
In Burp Suite, go to the Proxy tab → Intercept → Make sure it’s ON.

Visit any site from Firefox. The request will appear in Burp.

You can:

View/edit the request

Forward it

Drop it

🔄 Step 6: Use Other Burp Tools
Tool	Purpose
Target	View and map the site structure
Spider	Crawl the web app automatically
Scanner (Pro only)	Automatically find vulnerabilities
Intruder	Brute-force or fuzz input fields
Repeater	Manually modify and resend requests
Decoder	Encode/decode data (e.g., Base64)
Comparer	Compare two HTTP messages
Extender	Add Burp extensions (BApp Store)

✅ Example: Using Repeater
Right-click on any request in Proxy tab → Click Send to Repeater.

Go to the Repeater tab.

Modify the request as needed and click Send.

Analyze the response.

💡 Tips
Always turn off Intercept after analyzing, or browsing will be blocked.

Use Scope settings to limit what Burp listens to.

Combine Burp with other Kali tools (like Nmap, Dirb, etc.) for complete assessments.
