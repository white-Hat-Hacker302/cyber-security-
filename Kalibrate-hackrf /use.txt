📦 What is Kalibrate-HackRF?
Kalibrate-HackRF is a tool that allows you to:

Scan GSM base station frequencies.

Detect nearby cell towers.

Measure frequency offsets.

It is specifically designed to work with HackRF SDR hardware.

✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Use Kalibrate-HackRF in Kali Linux
1. 🔧 Install Dependencies
Open your terminal and install the required tools:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git cmake libhackrf-dev build-essential
2. 📥 Clone and Build Kalibrate-HackRF
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/scateu/kalibrate-hackrf.git
cd kalibrate-hackrf
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
This installs kal binary in your system.

🚀 3. Scan GSM Frequencies
Run the following command to scan all standard GSM frequency bands:

bash
Copy
Edit
kal -s GSM900
You can also scan other bands like:

GSM850

DCS1800

PCS1900

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
kal -s DCS1800
This will output nearby GSM towers and their frequencies.

📡 4. Calibrate Frequency Offset
To find the frequency offset of your HackRF:

bash
Copy
Edit
kal -s GSM900 -g 40
Replace -g 40 with your preferred gain value (usually 30–50).

The output will show:

Channel

Frequency

Power

Frequency offset

📘 5. Example Full Command
bash
Copy
Edit
kal -s GSM900 -g 44
Output example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Found 1 possible base stations:
chan:  50 (935.0MHz + 1.085kHz)    power: 154420
🛠️ Troubleshooting
🔌 HackRF not found?

Run hackrf_info to test if it's connected.

Use sudo if needed: sudo kal -s GSM900

⚠️ Permission issues?
Add your user to plugdev:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
reboot
🧠 Tips
Combine with Wireshark + OsmocomBB for GSM sniffing.

Use external antenna for better signal reception.

Use kal -h to view all command options.
