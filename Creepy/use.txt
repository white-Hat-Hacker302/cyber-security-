Step 3: 🔍 Using Creepy for OSINT
Enter Target Username:

Input the Twitter, Instagram, or Flickr username you want to gather info about.

Select Data Sources:

Enable APIs like Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc.

You'll need to enter API keys for some platforms due to their access restrictions.

Configure Filters (Optional):

Filter by date, location, or keywords.

Start Search:

Click “Gather Info”.

Creepy will extract geotagged data from available images/posts.

View Map:

The geolocation data is plotted on an interactive map view.

You can zoom, select specific pins, and see metadata such as coordinates, time, platform, and more.

📁 Features
