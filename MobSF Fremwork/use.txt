âœ… Step 5: Using MobSF
ðŸ“Œ For Static Analysis:
Drag and drop your APK, IPA, or APPX file into the web interface.

MobSF will automatically analyze the file.

You will see reports with:

Permissions

API calls

Security issues

Hardcoded secrets

And more

ðŸ“Œ For Dynamic Analysis (Android only):
You need to set up MobSF VM/Emulator.

Install Android SDK & Emulator, or use a MobSF Docker container.

Once running, upload APK and click Dynamic Analysis.

âœ… Optional: Use Docker (Easier Setup)
If you prefer Docker:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git
cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
docker build -t mobsf .
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 mobsf
Then open: http://localhost:8000

ðŸ“˜ Tips
Make sure Java and Python 3.8+ are installed correctly.

You can integrate MobSF API into automated pipelines for CI/CD.

Always analyze apps in a safe and legal environment.
