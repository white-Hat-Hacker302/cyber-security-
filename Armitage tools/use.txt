🔧 Step-by-Step: How to Use Armitage in Kali Linux
✅ 1. Start the Metasploit Database
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo msfdb init
Make sure the database is initialized and running. Armitage needs it to function.

✅ 2. Launch Armitage
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo armitage
A GUI window will appear.

Leave default settings:

Host: 127.0.0.1

Port: 55553

User: msf

Password: msf

Click "Connect"

If prompted to start Metasploit, click "Yes".

✅ 3. Scan and Discover Targets
Click “Hosts > Nmap Scan > Intense Scan” or use your own IP range.

You can also manually add hosts via Hosts > Add Hosts.

✅ 4. Exploit a Target
Right-click on the discovered host.

Select “Scan” to enumerate services.

Right-click again > Attack > Browse available exploits.

Choose an exploit > Click Launch.

✅ 5. Gain a Shell
If successful, the session opens in Metasploit Console at the bottom.

Use Meterpreter commands for post-exploitation:

bash
Copy
Edit
sysinfo
getuid
webcam_snap
hashdump
✅ 6. Use Post-Exploitation Modules
Right-click compromised host > Explore > ...

Example: Privilege escalation, keyloggers, pivoting, etc.

💡 Tips
Always run Armitage as root or with sudo.

Use VPN or test lab — never use against unauthorized systems.

To stop:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
