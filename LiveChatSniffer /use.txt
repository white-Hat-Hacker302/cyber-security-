Steps to Use LiveChatSniffer in Kali Linux
1. Install Required Dependencies
Before running LiveChatSniffer, ensure you have the necessary libraries:

bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libpcap-dev libnet1-dev
2. Download LiveChatSniffer
You can find the tool on GitHub or other repositories:

bash
git clone https://github.com/0x0XFF/LiveChatSniffer.git
cd LiveChatSniffer
(If the repo is unavailable, you may need to find an alternative source or precompiled binary.)

3. Compile the Tool (if required)
If the source code is available, compile it:

bash
gcc -o LiveChatSniffer LiveChatSniffer.c -lpcap -lnet
4. Run LiveChatSniffer
Execute the tool with root privileges (required for packet sniffing):

bash
sudo ./LiveChatSniffer
Or, if you have a binary:

bash
chmod +x LiveChatSniffer
sudo ./LiveChatSniffer
5. Select the Network Interface
The tool should list available interfaces. Choose the one connected to the network you want to monitor (e.g., eth0, wlan0).

6. Monitor Captured Chats
If any unencrypted chat traffic (e.g., old MSN/Yahoo Messenger) is detected, it will be displayed in the terminal.

Important Notes
Outdated Tool: Most modern chat apps (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram) use end-to-end encryption, making this tool ineffective.

Legal & Ethical Considerations:

Sniffing network traffic without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions.

Only use this tool on networks you own or have explicit authorization to test.

Alternatives:

For educational purposes, try Wireshark (sudo wireshark) to analyze network traffic.

For modern pentesting, focus on authorized security assessments using tools like Burp Suite or Bettercap.
