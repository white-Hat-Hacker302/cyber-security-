 Step-by-Step Guide to Use WiFiDump in Kali Linux
⚠️ Root permission required
⚠️ Use only on networks you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal.

🛠️ Step 1: Enable Monitor Mode
First, identify your wireless interface:

bash
Copy
Edit
iwconfig
Put your Wi-Fi adapter into monitor mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
airmon-ng start wlan0
This will change wlan0 to wlan0mon.

🛠️ Step 2: Install WiFiDump (if not installed)
If WiFiDump is not already included:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo git clone https://github.com/derv82/wifidump.git
cd wifidump
chmod +x wifidump.py
Or install using pip (if available as Python package):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install wifidump
🛠️ Step 3: Run WiFiDump
Basic usage:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python wifidump.py -i wlan0mon
This will start sniffing packets on monitor interface.

🧰 Optional Flags (if supported by your version):
-i — Interface name (e.g., wlan0mon)

-c — Channel to sniff

-o — Output file to save captured data

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python wifidump.py -i wlan0mon -c 6 -o output.cap
📂 Step 4: Analyze Captured Packets
Captured .cap files can be opened with:

bash
Copy
Edit
wireshark output.cap
Or use aircrack-ng, tshark, etc., to analyze the packets further.

🔚 Step 5: Stop Monitor Mode
Once done, disable monitor mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
💡 Tips:
Use near the target Wi-Fi to ensure signal strength.

Try changing channels to capture other traffic.

Combine with tools like aircrack-ng, Wireshark, or tshark for deeper analysis.
