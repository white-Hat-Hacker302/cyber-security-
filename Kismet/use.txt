🔧 Step 1: Install Kismet (if not installed)
Kismet comes pre-installed in Kali, but if it’s missing:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kismet
📶 Step 2: Put Wireless Adapter in Monitor Mode
First, find your wireless adapter name:

bash
Copy
Edit
iwconfig
Then enable monitor mode (replace wlan0 with your interface):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
Or use:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
▶️ Step 3: Launch Kismet
Start Kismet from terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo kismet
On first run, it may ask for setup. Kismet runs a web interface, usually at:
📍 http://localhost:2501

🧩 Step 4: Configure Kismet Interface
Once it opens in your browser:

Go to Data Sources

Click Add Source

Enter interface name (e.g. wlan0mon)

Choose source type (Wi-Fi)

Click Add

🔍 Step 5: Start Scanning
Kismet will begin scanning all wireless networks:

View SSIDs (network names)

See hidden networks

Track clients connected to APs

Detect signal strength, encryption (WEP/WPA/WPA2)

💾 Step 6: Save or Analyze Logs
Kismet logs can be saved and viewed later:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/kismet_logs/
You’ll find:

.pcapng files (for Wireshark)

.netxml (network metadata)

.kismet (Kismet sessions)

💡 Useful Features in Kismet
✅ Captures hidden SSIDs

📡 Detects rogue access points

🔍 Tracks Wi-Fi clients and their movement

🧠 Passive sniffing (no packet injection needed)

🎯 GPS logging (when used with GPS device)

🛑 Stop Monitor Mode
After you're done:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
🧠 Tips
Kismet is passive, so it won’t generate traffic = stealthy.

Best used with external USB Wi-Fi adapters that support monitor mode (e.g., Alfa AWUS036ACH).

For Bluetooth or SDR support, install corresponding plugins.
